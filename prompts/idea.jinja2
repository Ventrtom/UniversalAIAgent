## Problem
Our maintenance costs grew 15 % YoY due to frequent unplanned packaging‑line stops.

## Proposed solution
Monitor vibration and temperature, predict failures 48 h ahead and auto‑schedule maintenance.

## Business value
- Reduce downtime by 10 h / month  
- Save €30 k per quarter  

## Acceptance criteria
- **Given** line sensors are online  
- **When** failure probability > 70 % is detected  
- **Then** a work order is created and a maintenance slot reserved  

### Raw Idea
SUMMARY: {{ summary }}
DESCRIPTION: {{ description or '(none)' }}

### Task
Rewrite the Raw Idea into a polished Jira Idea description using the **same four headings** (Problem, Proposed solution, Business value, Acceptance criteria).  
Use active voice, quantify benefits, avoid jargon, keep total ≤ {{ max_words }} words.
